Alexander Wang Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/40188e1c-6d2e-4f20-9391-607bd3054949/resource/fd095080-d32c-4669-8b62-c80f4f32723a/download/employment.csv
This dataset shows the total jobs located in a neighborhood.

Abstract: We chose these three datasets because they are the typical criteria for justifying a good neighborhood. The home value within the neighborhood would be a clear indicator of whether or not the town is making significant money. The employment would show whether or not the amount of money being brought in is a neighborhood commonality because more people would be in jobs. The crime per capita would demonstrate whether or not a neighborhood is safe after is is proven to be a beneficial place to live.
